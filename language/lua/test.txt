Lua (/ˈluːə/ LOO-ə; from Portuguese: lua [ˈlu.(w)ɐ] meaning moon)[a] is a
lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily
for embedded use in applications.[2] Lua is cross-platform, since the
interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C,[3] and Lua has a
relatively simple C API to embed it into applications.[4]

Lua was originally designed in 1993 as a language for extending software
applications to meet the increasing demand for customization at the time. It
provided the basic facilities of most procedural programming languages, but
more complicated or domain-specific features were not included; rather, it
included mechanisms for extending the language, allowing programmers to
implement such features. As Lua was intended to be a general embeddable
extension language, the designers of Lua focused on improving its speed,
portability, extensibility, and ease-of-use in development.
